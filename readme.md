A `README.md` file is essential for providing an overview, setup instructions, usage details, and other relevant information about your `1DailyCalendar` project. Since this is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the `README.md` should be concise, user-friendly, and informative for both users and potential contributors. I'll craft a `README.md` that covers the project's purpose, features, setup, usage, and contribution guidelines, while reflecting the updates made (e.g., circular buttons, theme toggle, new features like Today button, Clear All, Note Counter, and keyboard shortcuts).

## Installation

1DailyCalendar is a static web application and requires no backend. Follow these steps to run it locally:

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A local server (optional, but recommended for best experience, e.g., using VS Code's Live Server extension).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/1DailyCalendar.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username or repository URL.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 1DailyCalendar
   ```

3. **Ensure Directory Structure**:
   ```
   1DailyCalendar/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Elements/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myLogo.png    # Favicon (ensure this file exists)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html        # Main application
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index2.html       # User guide
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # This file
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in your browser (drag and drop or double-click).
   - Option 2 (Recommended): Serve the project using a local server to avoid CORS issues with file imports:
     - If using VS Code, install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and click "Go Live".
     - Alternatively, use a simple HTTP server:
       ```bash
       python -m http.server 8000
       ```
       Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Navigate the Calendar**:
   - Use the `‚óÄ` and `‚ñ∂` buttons to change months.
   - Click the `Today` button to jump to the current month (today's date is highlighted with a red border).

2. **Add/Edit Notes**:
   - Click on any day to open the note editor.
   - Enter a title and details, then click `Save`. Empty notes are deleted upon saving.

3. **Search Notes**:
   - Use the search bar to find notes by date, title, or content.
   - Click a result to jump to that date.

4. **Manage Notes**:
   - Export notes as a JSON file with the `Export` button (`Ctrl + E`).
   - Import notes from a JSON file with the `Import` button (`Ctrl + I`).
   - Clear all notes with the `Clear All` button (`Ctrl + Shift + C`); confirm when prompted.

5. **Theme Toggle**:
   - Click the `üåô` (moon) or `‚òÄÔ∏è` (sun) button next to the date to switch between dark and light modes.

6. **View Note Count**:
   - The number of notes in the current month is displayed below the calendar.

7. **Access the Guide**:
   - Click the `Guide` button to view the user guide (`index2.html`) for detailed instructions.

## Screenshots Setup (Optional)

To add screenshots to this README:
1. Take screenshots of the app in both light and dark modes.
2. Save them in the project directory (e.g., `screenshots/light-mode.png` and `screenshots/dark-mode.png`).
3. Update the "Screenshots" section above with the correct paths:
   ```markdown
   ![Light Mode](screenshots/light-mode.png)
   ![Dark Mode](screenshots/dark-mode.png)
   ```

### Additional Notes

- **Screenshots**: I included a placeholder for screenshots. To add them, take screenshots of the app in both light and dark modes, save them in a `screenshots/` directory (e.g., `screenshots/light-mode.png`), and update the paths in the `README.md`. If you need help generating screenshots, let me know!
- **Live Demo**: If you host the app (e.g., on GitHub Pages), add the URL to the "Demo" section.
- **License**: I assumed the MIT License, which is common for open-source projects. If you prefer a different license (e.g., GPL, Apache), let me know, and I'll update it. You'll also need to create a `LICENSE` file in the repository.
- **Mir Mohmmad Luqman**: Replace `[Mir Mohmmad Luqman]` in the footer with your actual name or handle.
- **Directory Structure**: Ensure `Elements/myLogo.png` exists for the favicon. If you don't have this file, either remove the favicon reference in `index.html` and `index2.html` or add a placeholder image.
